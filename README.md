# type-single-page
 
 I was inspired by grunge posters and wanted a font that would appear on these posters. I wanted very bright  and striking colors that would make the website pop. 

This website uses two fonts, Angst, the main one, which is used on the animations. The other type is DM Serif which is uses for larger bodies of text. I also used a drop cap to make the site more unique and fit the grunge posters I was inspired by.
